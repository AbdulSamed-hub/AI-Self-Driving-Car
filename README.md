# AI Self-Driving Car 🏎️🤖

**AI Self-Driving Car** is a web-based simulation built in JavaScript, featuring traffic, collisions, and a neural network that learns with a genetic algorithm. This project demonstrates how AI can adapt to dynamic environments and improve its driving behavior over time.

---

## Features
- **Self-Driving Simulation:** Navigate a car through traffic with collision detection.
- **Neural Network AI:** The car “learns” how to drive better using a neural network.
- **Genetic Algorithm Learning:** AI improves over generations through evolution-style learning.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch the AI adapt in real-time as it drives.
